### Prompt Describing Mobile Data for Analysis and Visualization

Here is a detailed description of the mobile provider datasets available for our analysis. The goal is to compare this mobile data with public statistical data (from INE, Padrón, etc.) to gain a deeper understanding of population and tourism dynamics in Castilla-La Mancha. The final output should be Python code that performs these comparisons and generates insightful graphics.

**Overall Data Context:**
The mobile data is aggregated from user devices and provides a dynamic view of the population. It is available for each of the 5 provincial capitals and for the entire Castilla-La Mancha community (`CCAA Castilla-La Mancha`). The data is split into three main concepts:
1.  **Nocturno:** Monthly unique counts of users staying overnight, representing the most stable population of residents and tourists.
2.  **Diario:** Monthly unique counts of users present during the day, capturing a broader population including commuters and day-trippers.
3.  **NocheEstancia:** Daily data detailing the length of stay for overnight visitors.

### SET 1: Monthly Overnight Population (`Nocturno` Files)

These files are the most crucial for comparing against official population and tourism statistics. They represent the monthly unique users who spend the night in the region.

* **File 1: `Nocturno_Mes_demographics_analysis.parquet`**
    * **Description:** Provides a demographic breakdown (age and gender) of the overnight population, segmented by high-level origin. The demographic data is in a "wide" format, with separate columns for each age/gender volume.
    * **Data Dictionary:**
        * `mes`: The month of the data, in `YYYYMM` format (e.g., `202206`).
        * `origen`: The primary user segment:
            * `Local`: Users whose home location is within Castilla-La Mancha.
            * `NoLocal`: Users from other provinces in Spain (domestic tourists).
            * `Extranjero`: Users from other countries (foreign tourists).
        * `categoriadelvisitante`: A sub-category providing more detail:
            * `Residente`: The core resident population (use in combination with `origen: Local`).
            * `Turista`: The core tourist population (use in combination with `origen: NoLocal` or `Extranjero`).
            * `Habitualmente presente`: Likely second-home owners or long-term visitors.
        * `volumen_total`: The total number of unique users for the month in that segment.
        * `volumen_edad_*`: Columns containing the number of users within specific age brackets (e.g., `volumen_edad_18-24`).
        * `volumen_genero_*`: Columns for male (`_h`) and female (`_m`) users.
    * **Potential Comparison Points:**
        * The `Nocturno` data for `origen: Local` and `categoriadelvisitante: Residente` should be compared with the annual population figures from the public **Padrón** and **ECP** files to validate the resident baseline.
        * The tourist segments (`NoLocal` and `Extranjero`) can be compared with the monthly **EOH** data (`Viajeros` and `Pernoctaciones`) from the public sources.

* **File 2: `Nocturno_Mes_origin_analysis.parquet`**
    * **Description:** Provides a detailed geographical breakdown of the origin of the overnight population.
    * **Data Dictionary:**
        * `origen_detalle`: The specific place of origin (e.g., `Alemania`, `Madrid`, `Andalucía`). This provides the detail for the `origen` categories.
        * `provincia_detalle`: The specific province of origin for national visitors.
    * **Potential Comparison Points:**
        * The sum of `Extranjero` visitors over 12 months can be benchmarked against the annual **FRONTUR** data.
        * The breakdown by nationality can be analyzed for tourism marketing insights.

### SET 2: Monthly Daytime Population (`Diario` Files) ( Difficutl to compare to FRONTUR, better use arrivals and sum up, Diario sums same person several days...)

These files describe the total unique population present during the day, which is naturally larger than the overnight population as it includes commuters and day-trippers.

* **Files: `Diario_Mes_demographics_analysis.parquet` & `Diario_Mes_origin_analysis.parquet`**
    * **Description:** These files share the same structure as their `Nocturno` counterparts but measure daytime presence.
    * **Key Differences:** The `categoriadelvisitante` column includes additional values like `En tránsito` and `Excursionista`, which are crucial for understanding mobility patterns that are not captured in overnight data.
    * **Potential Comparison Points:** While there is no direct public data equivalent for a "daytime" population, this data can be used to show the total "load" on a province's infrastructure and services, providing context to the tourism figures.

### SET 3: Length of Stay Analysis (`NocheEstancia` Files)

These files provide daily data on the duration of stays for overnight visitors, which is essential for understanding visitor behavior.

* **Files: `NocheEstancia_demographics_analysis.parquet` & `NocheEstancia_origin_analysis.parquet`**
    * **Description:** These files provide daily counts of visitors based on how many nights they stay.
    * **Data Dictionary:**
        * `fecha`: The specific date of the record (e.g., `2022-06-01`).
        * `duracionestancia`: A categorical description of the stay length (e.g., `1 Noche`, `2 Noches`, `12 Noches`).
        * `duracionestancianum`: The numerical version of the stay length.
        * `volumen_total`: The number of users who stayed for that specific duration.
    * **Potential Comparison Points:**
        * By calculating a weighted average of `duracionestancianum` from this data, we can derive the **average length of stay** for mobile-data tourists.
        * This derived average can be directly compared to the average length of stay calculated from public data (i.e., **EOH Pernoctaciones / EOH Viajeros**). This is a key point of comparison.
