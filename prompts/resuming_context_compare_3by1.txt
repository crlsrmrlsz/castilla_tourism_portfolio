#previous context
I am resuming again the development of the code to contrast public official statistics against mobile phone anonymized data for tourism dataset in castilla la mancha, spain.

#objective
The objective is to compare two datasets with similar data, to ensure that mobile data is correct (may not be, as it is obtained extrapolating from operator's 30% market share (Orange) to total population, so it may have some assumption errors).
The other dataset is data from INE in Spain, more reliable but does not contain the same exact indicators, there are subtle differences.
I will use mobile data in the future to create touristic dashboards for potential customers and I want to know, and show the reliability of these mobile data by showing comparison graphics.


#method
I am comparing indicator by indicator to focus your intelligence on each case, one by one.
I have already compared indicator for :
- indicator 1: number of people spending night in castilla la mancha (ine hotel registers, vs mobile phones during night)
- indicator 2: population, census in INE vs mobile phones of residents.

A key point in mobile dataset is how each SIM card is categorized as a different type of visitor: resident, tourist, excursionist, and so on.
The time spend on a place is used to cathegorize it and define type of visitor (categoriadelvisitante in spanish, as found in dataset).
THe visitor types are these, as explained by mobile dataset provider:
-----
     * "Resident": A person who has spent more than 21 nights in the analyzed area over the last 8 weeks. In other words, someone is considered a resident of Gandía if their mobile phone was detected at night in Gandía at least 22 times in the last 56 nights (8 weeks).
     Examples:
     - Jorge lives and works in Valencia. He is counted as a resident of Valencia.
     - Elena is a French teacher in Cartagena and spends every summer in Benidorm at her late grandmother’s house. Since she has two months of vacation, Elena will be counted as a resident around mid-summer.

     * "Frequently Present": A person who spends fewer than 22 nights in the area over the last 8 weeks but has been detected at least once per week across 4 different weeks. In other words, someone is "frequently present" if they are observed in the area during four different weeks but with fewer than 22 total nights in the last 8 weeks.
     Example:
     - Laura is enrolled in a hybrid master's program in Valencia and stays overnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Benimaclet neighborhood. Laura is considered "frequently present" in Benimaclet.

     * "Tourist": Someone who spends fewer than 22 nights and is observed in fewer than 4 different weeks over the last 8 weeks.
     Examples:
     - Nuria is from Xàbia but went out for drinks in Dénia on Saturday and returned at 5 AM. Since she spent most of the night in Dénia, she is counted as a tourist in Dénia with an origin in Xàbia.
     - Ivanna is from St. Petersburg and spends a couple of weeks each year in Torreblanca. She is considered a tourist.
     - Miguel is from Dénia but works in Barcelona. When he returns for Christmas to spend time with his family, he is counted as a tourist in Dénia (with Dénia as his origin since that’s where his phone contract was registered).

     * "Day Visitor" A person observed in the area during the day for more than 2 hours but not the night before or the night of the analysis. In other words, they are only seen during the day, with a presence exceeding 2 hours, but not recurrently.
     Examples:
     - Sofía is a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company and typically visits 2-3 towns to present new products or have lunch with clients. She is counted as a day visitor in towns where she doesn’t stay overnight and as a tourist where she does.
     - Alberto is vacationing on the Levante coast, staying in Calpe for a few days, and decides to try a recommended restaurant in Altea. On the day he visits, he is counted as a day visitor in Altea.

     * "Recurrent Day Visitor"*: A person present for more than 2 hours during the day on more than 5 days in the last 15. In other words, if someone visits the observed area more than 5 times in the last two weeks but only during the day (not overnight), they are a recurrent day visitor.
     Examples:
     - Isabel lives in Calpe but attends a school in Benidorm. She has classes Monday to Friday from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. During the school year, Isabel is a recurrent day visitor in Benidorm.
     - Ismael is a dentist who lives and works in Xàtiva but collaborates 3 days a week with another clinic in Dénia. He is a recurrent day visitor in Dénia.

     * "In Transit": A person observed in the area during the day for less than 2 hours and not seen the night before or the night of the analysis. In other words, they are passing through, differing from day visitors only in their shorter presence (<2 hours).
     Examples:
     - Marc works daily in Benidorm but is from Calpe. He picks up a coworker in Altea to carpool. Marc is counted as "in transit" in Altea.
     - Enrique is a truck driver who stops at a Valencia gas station to refuel and have coffee. He is counted as "in transit" in Valencia.

     * "Tourist/Frequently Present/Resident in Transit": A tourist, frequently present individual, or resident who spends less than 2 hours in the observation zone between 6 AM and 12 AM.

    Clarifications:
     - "Day Visitor," "Recurrent Day Visitor," and "In Transit" do not spend the night in the observation zone. All other categories do spend the night there.
     - Any person present between 12 AM and 6 AM and "inactive" in the zone (predominantly in the observation area for more than 2 hours) is segmented as **Resident, Tourist, or Frequently Present**.
     - The determination of Day Visitor (>2h) vs. In Transit (<2h) is based on activity between 6 AM and 12 PM.

#date range
june 2022 to december 2024
each dataset may contain different time aggregation, it is important to compare similar periods or aggregations.
Mobile data is aggregated by month. This is tricky, as it is obtained summing up data for each day.


# indicators to compare this time
indicator 3: This time we will compare number of tourists in castilla la mancha, the whole community.
We have two datasets

1.INE data:
* File Name: INE_FRONTUR_Total_anual_CLM
location in project structure:
 data/raw/ine_data/
 ├── INE_FRONTUR_Total_anual_CLM.csv

Thousand separator is '.'

2. MOBILE DATA.

* File Names: Llegada_demographics_analysis.parquet,   inside 'data\analytics\CCAA Castilla-La Mancha'
* Description: Tourists/frequent visitors who stayed overnight after not being detected in the area the two prior nights
* Columns:
    Date is in column "mes"
    column "origen" is "Extranjero" for foreign, "Local" for people from Castilla La Mancha, and "NoLocal" people from the rest of Spain.
    column "categoriadelvisitante" is important as contains the type of visitor.
    date range columns (not used): ranges: <18, 18-24,25-34,35-44, 45-54, 55-64 , >65], , just for locals (people from Castilla La Mancha) and nolocals (people from spain but not castilla la mancha)
    gender columns (not used): 'volumen_genero_h' (hombre), 'volumen_genero_m' (mujer), 'volumen_genero_nr' (not responding)
    volumen_total: total of people

Nuances of the comparison:
***
 Analyze if any other category should be used from mobile data, apart from tourist.
 Tourist in mobile data is just people who stay overnight, but an excursionist is also a tourist not spending the night. It would be a good idea to sum up both but distinguish in the graphs the contribution of each one to the total number.
 Analyze visitor categories in detail to understand and include the types that can be comparable with frontur data.
 Mobile data distinguish between foreign and local and nolocal, but INE data is just for foreign people, so filter accordingly.
 Anyway search the web to see if FRONTUR data from INE is just for foreign people.
 INE data is anual, and mobile data is aggregated monthly or daily.
 ***


#Result:
 The final result must be graphics comparing both datasets, with the same style as the ones I already have done.
 I think bar graphs are a good option, but please analyze any other option for representing these data.

#How:
***

Please analyze the code files for the previous indicator, and generate the code and graphics in the same style and file structure, one helper and one notebook.
Ensure the code is simple and clean and don't hesitate to do it better than the attached files if you can.
I attach them just to enrich your context.


previous indicator 1:
-hotel_data_helpers.py
-hotel_data_quality_check
previous indicator 2:
-population_data_helpers.py
-population_data_quality_check
Leave previous code unchanged.

 And this is the structure of my pycharm project (that will contain the real final objetive, that is create a website showing mobile data analysis, all these indicator are just a initial phase to validate data quality and significance:
