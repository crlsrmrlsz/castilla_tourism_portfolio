#previous context
I am resuming again the development of the code to contrast public official statistics against mobile phone anonymized data for tourism dataset in castilla la mancha, spain.

#objective
The objective is to compare two datasets with similar data, to ensure that mobile data is correct as it is obtained extrapolating from operator's 30% market share (Orange) to total population, so it may have some assumption errors.
The other dataset is data from INE in Spain, more reliable but not the same exact indicators.
I will use mobile data in the future to create touristic dashboards for potential customers and I want to know, and show the reliability of these mobile data by showing comparison graphics.


#method
I am comparing indicator by indicator to focus your intelligence on each case, one by one.
I have already compared indicator for :
- number of people spending night in castilla la mancha.

#date range
june 2022 to december 2024
each dataset may contain different time aggregation, it is important to compare similar periods or aggregations


# indicators to compare this time

Population, this is a good indicator to compare as there are less conceptual differences between public data statistics and how mobile data is interpreted.
There are two datasets, population at community scope and at city scope , for the 5 capitals of the castilla la mancha provinces.
I will explai both comparisons:

1.COMMUNITY LEVEL:

a.From public dataset: population, obtained from municipal census
* File Names: `ECP_CLM_2022_enero.csv`, `ECP_CLM_2023_enero.csv`, `ECP_CLM_2024_enero.csv`, inside 'data\raw\ine_data'
* Description: This set of files contains detailed population data from the `Estadística de Padrón Continuo` (Continuous Population Register). Each file corresponds to the month of January or July for a specific year.
* Columns:
    `Edad`: The primary column, listing single years of age from "0 años" to "100 y más años", and a total at the last row containing the sum of people from any age.
    Geographical Columns: `ALBACETE`, `CIUDAD REAL`, `CUENCA`, `GUADALAJARA`, `TOLEDO`, and totals for `CASTILLA-LA MANCHA` and `ESPAÑA`. (provinces and whole community, these are province scope data, not valuable for us, just use community)
    Sub-columns: Each geographical area is broken down by `Total`, `Hombres` (Men), and `Mujeres` (Women).
* Meaning: These files provide a granular, yearly snapshot of the population structure, broken down by single year of age, gender, and geographical area.
* Example Data (from ECP_CLM_2023_enero.csv):

b. From mobile dataset: monthly aggregated data for visitors in castilla la mancha

* File Names: Diario_Mes_demographics_analysis.parquet, inside 'data\analytics\CCAA Castilla-La Mancha'
* Description: monthly aggregated data of number of people , segmented by age, gender, origin and type of visitor (categoriadelvisitante)
* Columns:
    Date is in column "mes"
    column "origen" is "Extranjero" for foreign, "Local" for people from Castilla La Mancha, and "NoLocal" people from the rest of Spain.
    column "categoriadelvisitante" is important as contains the type of visitor. These are the descriptions and examples of use for possible categories, these categories are calculated by mobile data provider accordint to temporal and spatial behaviour (in english, but data in the file is in spanish):
    date range columns: ranges: <18, 18-24,25-34,35-44, 45-54, 55-64 , >65], , just for locals (people from Castilla La Mancha) and nolocals (people from spain but not castilla la mancha)
    gender columns: 'volumen_genero_h' (hombre), 'volumen_genero_m' (mujer), 'volumen_genero_nr' (not responding)
    volumen_total: total of people
    -----
     * "Resident": A person who has spent more than 21 nights in the analyzed area over the last 8 weeks. In other words, someone is considered a resident of Gandía if their mobile phone was detected at night in Gandía at least 22 times in the last 56 nights (8 weeks).
     Examples:
     - Jorge lives and works in Valencia. He is counted as a resident of Valencia.
     - Elena is a French teacher in Cartagena and spends every summer in Benidorm at her late grandmother’s house. Since she has two months of vacation, Elena will be counted as a resident around mid-summer.

     * "Frequently Present": A person who spends fewer than 22 nights in the area over the last 8 weeks but has been detected at least once per week across 4 different weeks. In other words, someone is "frequently present" if they are observed in the area during four different weeks but with fewer than 22 total nights in the last 8 weeks.
     Example:
     - Laura is enrolled in a hybrid master's program in Valencia and stays overnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Benimaclet neighborhood. Laura is considered "frequently present" in Benimaclet.

     * "Tourist": Someone who spends fewer than 22 nights and is observed in fewer than 4 different weeks over the last 8 weeks.
     Examples:
     - Nuria is from Xàbia but went out for drinks in Dénia on Saturday and returned at 5 AM. Since she spent most of the night in Dénia, she is counted as a tourist in Dénia with an origin in Xàbia.
     - Ivanna is from St. Petersburg and spends a couple of weeks each year in Torreblanca. She is considered a tourist.
     - Miguel is from Dénia but works in Barcelona. When he returns for Christmas to spend time with his family, he is counted as a tourist in Dénia (with Dénia as his origin since that’s where his phone contract was registered).

     * "Day Visitor" A person observed in the area during the day for more than 2 hours but not the night before or the night of the analysis. In other words, they are only seen during the day, with a presence exceeding 2 hours, but not recurrently.
     Examples:
     - Sofía is a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company and typically visits 2-3 towns to present new products or have lunch with clients. She is counted as a day visitor in towns where she doesn’t stay overnight and as a tourist where she does.
     - Alberto is vacationing on the Levante coast, staying in Calpe for a few days, and decides to try a recommended restaurant in Altea. On the day he visits, he is counted as a day visitor in Altea.

     * "Recurrent Day Visitor"*: A person present for more than 2 hours during the day on more than 5 days in the last 15. In other words, if someone visits the observed area more than 5 times in the last two weeks but only during the day (not overnight), they are a recurrent day visitor.
     Examples:
     - Isabel lives in Calpe but attends a school in Benidorm. She has classes Monday to Friday from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. During the school year, Isabel is a recurrent day visitor in Benidorm.
     - Ismael is a dentist who lives and works in Xàtiva but collaborates 3 days a week with another clinic in Dénia. He is a recurrent day visitor in Dénia.

     * "In Transit": A person observed in the area during the day for less than 2 hours and not seen the night before or the night of the analysis. In other words, they are passing through, differing from day visitors only in their shorter presence (<2 hours).
     Examples:
     - Marc works daily in Benidorm but is from Calpe. He picks up a coworker in Altea to carpool. Marc is counted as "in transit" in Altea.
     - Enrique is a truck driver who stops at a Valencia gas station to refuel and have coffee. He is counted as "in transit" in Valencia.

     * "Tourist/Frequently Present/Resident in Transit": A tourist, frequently present individual, or resident who spends less than 2 hours in the observation zone between 6 AM and 12 AM.

    Clarifications:
     - "Day Visitor," "Recurrent Day Visitor," and "In Transit" do not spend the night in the observation zone. All other categories do spend the night there.
     - Any person present between 12 AM and 6 AM and "inactive" in the zone (predominantly in the observation area for more than 2 hours) is segmented as **Resident, Tourist, or Frequently Present**.
     - The determination of Day Visitor (>2h) vs. In Transit (<2h) is based on activity between 6 AM and 12 PM.

Nuances of the comparison:
***
 The main point here is what king of cateogriadelvisitante is considered as population, to be compared with public data.
 Resident is clearly in, but it need to be considered if any other type may also be population.
 Frequently Present is a clear candidate.
 Please analyze if any other type may be included.
 Anyway, i want to print the contribution of each type to the comparison, so it can be clearly seen which type contributes more or less
 The public data does not distinguish between foreign and spanish, so both origins must sum to the comparison.
***

2. CITY LEVEL.

There is also data at city level:

a. public dataset:

File name: INE_AB_padron_genero_anual
* File Names: INE_AB_padron_genero_anual, inside 'data\raw\ine_data', AB is for Albacete, there is one file for each city (TO, GU, CR, CU).
* Description: anual data, aggregated by gender of population in the city
* Columns:
    Municipios; city
    Sexo; gender (total for the aggregation)
    Periodo; year
    Total: number of people

* Sample data:

02 Albacete;Mujeres;2023;193.498
02 Albacete;Mujeres;2022;192.764

b. mobile dataset

Same as for 1. COMMUNITY LEVEL, but file is located in a different folder for each city, for example for AB (Albacete)
 data/analytics/
  ├── AB Albacete/
Project fodler structure is explained later in this prompt.


#Result:
 The final result must be graphics comparing both datasets. One graphic for community level and other for the 5 cities.
 The graphics must compare total numbers and also differentiati age range and gender, to see how bothdataset match.
 PLease generate one set of graphs for total numbers and other for gender, and other for date range.
 I think bar graphs are a good option, but please analyze any other option for representing these data.



#How:
***

Please analyze the code files for the previous indicator, and generate the code and graphics in the same style and structure, reutilizing notebook and data_processing_helper.py.
Leave previous code unchanged.
